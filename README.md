### Dependencies
Dependencies are installed/managed with pip and virtual environment

If the `venv/` directory does not already exist, create it with
```
$ virtualenv venv
```
Every time you cd into this project, run
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
If you have problems importing pandas or seaborn
you probably need to install them
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
